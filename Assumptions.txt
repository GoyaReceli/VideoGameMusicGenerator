This ranking between intervals is our starting point while it raises two problems for our system. The first is that we have two data inputs, namely ``intensity'' and ``winning status'', while this approach provides only one ranking between intervals. And secondly, our algorithm depends on the fact that the note change at a given time is computed in relation to two other notes with equal importance in relation to the note to be changed. This means that we have not defined a single note that is hierarchically higher than others, the bass note being an example of one in chordal harmony analysis. So, a major third down means the same for our algorithm as a minor sixth up.
